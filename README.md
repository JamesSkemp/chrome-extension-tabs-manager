# Chrome Extension: Tabs Manager

Following https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/tut-tabs-manager/

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`

## Permissions
- `host_permissions`: Grant elevated permissions (tab title, URL, and other capabilities) only to certain sites.
	- Alternative would be `tabs` permission, but that would grant access to all tabs.
